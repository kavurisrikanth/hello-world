# hello-world
Just a beginner's hello world repository, as required by law.

Editing README file now, sir!
So, basically, I create repositories for projects.
They have a master branch by default.
Then I create as many branches as I like.
Then code changes, then commit the changes, and then make a pull request.

That's it, right?
